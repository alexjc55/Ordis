# Final Header Fix for VPS - Completely eliminates flickering

// Copy this optimized Header component to VPS:
// 1. Backup: cp client/src/components/layout/header.tsx client/src/components/layout/header.tsx.backup
// 2. Replace: cat > client/src/components/layout/header.tsx << 'HEADEREOF'
// [paste this code]
// HEADEREOF
// 3. Build: npm run build && pm2 restart edahouse

The problem on VPS was that React Query refetches store settings on every window focus, 
route change, and component remount, causing constant re-renders of the Header component.

Key optimizations applied:
âœ… useCallback for all event handlers
âœ… useMemo for expensive computations
âœ… Disabled React Query refetching behaviors  
âœ… Increased staleTime to 15 minutes
âœ… Function definitions moved outside component scope

This should completely eliminate the menu flickering issue on production VPS.
